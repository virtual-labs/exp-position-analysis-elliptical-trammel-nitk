The double slider-crank linkage has four links joined in a kinematic chain and consists of two revolute joints and two sliding or prismatic joints. Different mechanisms obtained by fixing different links of a kinematics chain are known as its inversions. Elliptical trammel mechanism is one of the inversions of a double slider crank linkage. It can be used for tracing an ellipse.
